# Basic Python Programming

Welcome to the **Basic Python Programming** repository! This project contains a collection of scripts and exercises that I completed while learning the fundamentals of Python programming.

## Overview

This repository covers:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding Python's basic data types and how to use them.
- **Control Flow**: Implementing `if` statements, loops (`for`, `while`), and other control structures.
- **Functions**: Creating and using functions to write reusable code.
- **Data Structures**: Working with lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files in Python.
- **Modules and Packages**: Importing and using Python's built-in and external libraries.
- **Error Handling**: Using `try`, `except`, and `finally` to manage errors gracefully.

## Getting Started

To run the Python scripts:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
